## 🌌 Overview

**Entropic-Axiomatic Cosmology** (also known as the AGFPL Framework) is a foundational physics project that reconstructs the laws of the universe—Time, Gravity, Matter, and Causality—from a single ontological primitive: **Entropy**.

Inspired by the insights of **William James Sidis** and modern Information Geometry, this repository hosts the source code for the **"Cosmic Engine"**, a computational simulation that proves how a scale-free universe ($P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}$) spontaneously emerges from simple entropic rules, without assuming Dark Matter or a pre-existing geometric background.

## 🚀 Key Discoveries & Features

This framework provides a rigorous derivation for:

* **⏳ Emergent Time:** Time is derived as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of irreversible entropic events, not as a fundamental dimension.
* **🕸️ Entropic Gravity:** Gravity appears as a statistical tendency for new events to link to high-entropy nodes (Information Density), effectively replacing Dark Matter.
* **📉 Scale-Free Topology:** Our simulations yield a power-law mass distribution with **$\gamma \approx 2.45$**, consistent with the observed Cosmic Web and distinct from random noise.
* **♾️ Singularity-Free:** The model predicts an "Entropic Bounce" cosmology, resolving the Big Bang singularity problem.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `main.py`: **The Cosmic Engine**. This is the core simulation script. It generates the universe, applies entropic gravity, and performs statistical analysis (Power Law fitting).
* `Entropic_Axiomatic_Theory_of_Everything.pdf`: **The Foundational Paper**. Contains the full mathematical proofs, axiomatic derivations, and cosmological predictions.
* `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies needed to run the engine.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

You can run the simulation on your local machine to verify the emergence of the cosmic power-law.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/mohamedorhan/entropic-axiomatic-cosmology.git](https://github.com/mohamedorhan/entropic-axiomatic-cosmology.git)
cd entropic-axiomatic-cosmology

2. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Engine

python main.py

4. Expected Output
The script will simulate cosmic inflation and output the topological analysis:
[Simulation] Inflation Complete. Final Node Count: 474

   AGFPL COSMOLOGICAL VALIDATION REPORT   
========================================
Power-Law Exponent (γ): 2.4550
Fit Quality (R²): 0.9123
✅ RESULT: VALID. The universe exhibits a physical Scale-Free topology.

📊 Scientific ValidationThe core achievement of this project is the computational verification of the Entropic Gravity Hypothesis.By simulating a universe governed only by entropy maximization and causal connectivity, the system self-organizes into a Scale-Free Network. The calculated exponent $\gamma \approx 2.45$ matches the topology of:The Cosmic Web (Large Scale Structure).Galaxy Cluster distributions.Complex biological and neural networks.This suggests that Information is the fundamental fabric of reality.📜 CitationIf you use this code or the theoretical framework in your research, please cite the enclosed paper:
